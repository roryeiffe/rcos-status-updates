Last Week's Accomplishments:
I worked on getting the Phone Controllers website on Phone Gap. I was able to get the text, colors, link, etc. on my phone but the link does not work. When it is clicked, nothing happens. I tried looking into various websites and changing some things around but nothing has worked yet.

This week's plan:
This week, I will continue to try to get the link to work. If I do not get it working soon, I will reach out to my mentors to see if they can help. 

Anything Blocking:
The link not working is the only obstacle I have faced this week.
