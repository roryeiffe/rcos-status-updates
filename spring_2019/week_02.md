Last Week's Accomplishments:
Last week, I continued to work on getting our project website onto my phone using PhoneGap. I was able to get the text and link to appear but, upon clicking the link, nothing happens. I tried looking into various website but nothing has worked yet.

This Week's Plan:
This week, I will continue looking into the link not working issue. If I finish this, I will start learning Unity so I can help out with a sample game to be used with Phone Controllers.

Anything Blocking:
The biggest issue is the fact the link does not work in Phone Gap. If I can not get it working soon, I will reach out to my mentors to see if they can help.
