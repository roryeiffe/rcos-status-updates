Last Week's Accomplishments:
Last week, I continued looking into why links do not work in the PhoneGap app. I tried a few different methods but nothing seemed to work. Other than that, I learned some preliminary knowledge about websockets before we decided to abandon that idea.

This Week's Plan:
Since were are switching gears to use Godot instead of Unity, I will refresh my memory on Godot. I started a project last year using Godot and, while I didn't finish it, I got pretty used to the syntax and other features of Godot so I should be able to get used to it again.

Anything Blocking:
Nothing is blocking me currently since I am just starting to learn/relearn Godot.

Notes:
NA.
