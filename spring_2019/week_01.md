## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I continued to become accustomed to Phone Gap, css, and html by working on my sample project. I figured out how to adjust the position of a piece of text using
percentages and I added a button that, when pressed, reveals a message. Unfortunately, there is a glitch that makes the background appear multiple times when I adjust the position of the text that I will try to fix this week. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to fix the background issue and continue to learn more about buttons and percentages by improving the sample program. Furthermore, I plan to get Max's (my teammate) website working with Phone Gap. 



## Anything Blocking?

> The Phone Gap application hasn't been working consistently; when I try to load the files onto my phone, it doesn't finish. Before, I can continue my work, I will need to make sure I troublehoot this issue.
